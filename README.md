This is my Repo. I'm an engineer of software, and working on the embedded system development. I like to study and develop on 
the operating system such as Linux and Android. I wish I can become a hack someday, but I have a lot of developed skill need 
to work hard for this. If you have any suggestion for me, Please feel free to let me know.
